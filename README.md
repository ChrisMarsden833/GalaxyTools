This respository containing a bunch of functions I use for galaxy stuff. Making this public as there are several functions in src/ that may be of use to other PhD students in the same field. More more detailed codes, please check out my other repositories.

This repository is a bit of a mess, but hopefully this could be useful for somebody.
